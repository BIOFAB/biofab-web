Friday:

- Talk to Vivek about:

    How should I calculate promoter and 5' UTR performance?
      This is for display in Expression Designer.

    Does the BCD vs. MCD view look ok?
      No: Should be GOI-mean-centered, not reporter-mean-centered
          Should be log2 before 0-100 normalization.
          Needs Y axis numbers and units.

    How should I calculate 5' UTR reliability?
      Just normalize the standard deviation to 0-10?
        meaning std_dev from BCD vs. MCD view?

- Import all plasmids as parts:
    script: import_google_doc_plasmids

- Annotate all plasmids:
    modify script: biofab-web-pilot/scripts/pilot_annotate
      Make it only run for plasmid parts.
      Make it delete existing annotations before running, for each part (plasmid).
      Make it only search for parts of type promoter, 5' UTR, GOI and terminator.
      Make it create real annotations instead of pilot-annotations.

    
Saturday:

- Calculate promoter and 5' UTR performance:
    Add a parts_values table and populate with values:
      performance
      performance_sd
      reliability (only for 
      reliability_sd

- Complete the Expression Selector!

    Fix data
      re-import data
      ensure no unwanted data is there
    Fix histogram (definitely wrong)
      add y-axis labels
    Better data in right-hand side.
    Show plasmid (copy code from bd_designs view).
    Make text-box for "must not contain".
    Remove "add constraint" button.
    Remove "add to cart" feature.
    Download as Genbank, plain text and SBOL.
    Download vivek's excel sheet link.

      BCD sequence diagram on mouse over bar chart
        copy from MCD vs. GOI view

  Add relevant links to top right side of pages

  Make front page links work.
  
Monday:

  Only if time:          
    Create PBD vs. BCD view
      3D bar chart
      Show EOU widget on click
        re-use from expression selector

  Add help information (do it in photoshop).


Tuesday:

  Put it in production mode.

  Make simple data-views for everything:
    Pilot [x]
    MPL and RPL [/]
    Terminator project [/]
    PBD [ ]
    BD-GOI [ ]
    Bicistronic library [ ]

If there is time:

  Terminator view:
    Bar-chart with one bar per terminator.
    Ask Guillaume what to show if one is clicked.

  RPL and MPL views:
    Copy BCD-library view.

Fix data:

  Questions for Vivek:

    1. Can I compare the BD-GOI measurements?
      Comparing a value between BD-GOI and PBD:
        BD-GOI: pTrc + BCD1 + GFP. Performance and std_dev: 365.98	34.77
        PBD: pTrc + BCD1 + GFP. Performance and std_dev: 462.95	68.40

    2. Are the FC averages in the spreadsheet log-scale?

    3. Should we use "advanced" performance measures for the 12 BCDs that have been tested more?
       Or should we just use the GFP performance from the "Randomized SD2 lib og BCD-GFP"-sheet for all?

    4. Why are there half-bicistronic designs in the PBD datasheet? (such as apFAB704)

    5. What's wrong with apFAB703 and apFAB704 in the google docs?

  Questions for Joao:

    1. Can I mean-center the standard deviations in the same way as the performances?

    2. Should I calculate separate scale-factors for GFP and RFP (between PBD and BD-GOI sets)
       or should I just make an average scale-factor.

  Fact: BD-GOI combinations all use pTrc promoter.

=== Maybe it's a good idea to do all of this in excel and just import after the fact! ===

  Designs imports both GFP and RFP values. Fix this:
    Import only all GFP. Skip performance values.

  Calculate normalized performance and standard deviation across GOIs (reliability):
    Calculate average performance of GOI across all BCDs.
    For each BCD-GOI combination, divide performance with the appropriate GOI-average.
      (if it is in log-space, subtract instead of divide)
      This will give the mean-centered performance for each BCD-GOI combination.
    Calculate the average of mean-centered performance for each BCD across all GOIs.
    Normalize the mean-centered performances to a scale of 0 to 100%.
      This will be the performance of a BCD (used when displaying the part diagram (OR NOT see Vivek question #3).
    Calculate the standard deviation of normalized mean-centered performance for each BCD across all GOIs (include GFP and RFP).
      This will be the reliability of a BCD.

  PBD calculations:
    Make the PBD values comparable to BD-GOI values:
      Two overlapping values (pTrc + BCD1 + GFP) and (pTrc + BCD1 + RFP).
      We want the BD-GOI equivalent for each of the two PBD values so:
        PBD_value * scale_factor = BD_GOI_value
        so: BD_GOI_value / PBD_value = scale_factor
      Calculate scale factor for GFP and for RFP and get average.
        (remember to use the non-mean-centered values when calculating scale factor)
      Multiply each PBD performance with scale_factor to get comparable values.

    Calculate the GOI-mean-centered performances of the Promoter-BCD combinations.
      (by dividing each of the performances with the appropriate GOI-average for the GOI used (either RFP or GFP))

    For each PBD calculate the average of the GOI-mean-centered performance of GFP and RFP (average of two).
      This is the per-PBD performance.

    Normalize the per-PBD performance to fit in a 0..100 range based on highest and lowest PBD performances.

----

Total todo:

  Create table for, and import, last sheet from Vivek's spreadsheet.

  Make simple "raw data" view (just copy pilot project view) for:
    5' UTRs (will likely need new table combining all three current tables)

  Fix welcome screen (look at drew's notes).

If time:

  Make nicer view for Terminator project.

  Make nicer view for pilot project.
